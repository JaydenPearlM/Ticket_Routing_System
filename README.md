# Ticket_Routing_System
A ticket routing program using FastAPI, Jupyter Notebook, and Python.

This is a project that we have done during the "Break Through Tech: Sprinternship."
The 'Sprinternship' was a three week Internship with a host company, this one was for Giant Eagle.
The Challenge was to write a machine Learning program to take tickets such as "Internet is Done" 
and it routes the ticket to the correct department such as "Networking Solutions"
SMOTE was also used in this project to help balance out the imbalanced Data.
Trained the Niave Bayes machine Learning model.  The model was picked because it is beginner friendly
and a Text Classifier.

The Accuracy for this projects output was 74% which was done in three weeks.
